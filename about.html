            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>I've been working in healthcare since 1998, bringing over 25 years of experience to Superior Medicine. As both a healthcare professional and a mother who has lived and raised a family in Superior, Colorado for over 25 years, I understand the unique healthcare needs of our community.</p>
            
            <p>My journey in healthcare began with a strong foundation in science. Originally from Florida, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Microbiology from the University of Florida. Seeking to make a more direct impact on patient care, I moved to Texas to pursue a Bachelor's in Nursing from Texas Women's University.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Practice Education</h2>
            <p>To expand my ability to serve patients, I pursued advanced education in family medicine. I graduated with a Master's in Nursing with a focus in Family Medicine from Regis University in 2022. This advanced training allows me to provide comprehensive primary care services including diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing health management.</p>
            
            <p>For the past 3 years, I have been working in both primary care and urgent care settings with a special focus on preventive medicine - helping patients maintain their health and catch potential issues early.</p>

            <h2>Why Concierge Medicine?</h2>
            <p>Having experienced the healthcare system both as a provider and as a parent, I understand the frustrations of long wait times, rushed appointments, and difficulty accessing care when you need it most. Superior Medicine was born from a desire to provide the kind of personalized, accessible healthcare that every family deserves.</p>
            
            <p>By bringing medical care directly to your home, I can spend the time needed to truly understand your health concerns, provide thorough assessments, and develop treatment plans that work for your lifestyle and schedule.</p>
